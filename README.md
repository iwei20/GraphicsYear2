# Crow Islands
Retaking the Stuyvesant Computer Graphics course (non-audit this time), using this as an opportunity to learn Rust.

Name inspired by AMD GPU series codenames between 2010 and ~2016. 

# Graphics Final Project
### Name: Ivan Wei
### Class Period: 5

## New Graphics Engine Features
- [x] Supersampling
- [x] Complete one of the alternate shading models
- [x] Special `vary` curves
- [x] Moving lights with `vary`
- [x] `light`
- [x] `set`
- [x] `saveknobs`
- [x] `tween`

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] `mesh`
- [ ] Texture mapping

## The Details
- Supersampling has been implemented at 16 samples per pixel.
- I plan to mainly focus on completing the alternate shading model first. Likely Gouraud or Phong interpolation, though I might try raytracing if I have time.
- All of the other commands will be implemented as described on the assignment page, mostly as a convenience for generating animation.
- After that will come the mesh obj parsing, if I have time.
- If I have time I will look to texture mapping onto my triangles.
