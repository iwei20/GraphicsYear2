# Graphics Final Project
### Name: Ivan Wei

## New Graphics Engine Features
- [x] Supersampling
- [x] Complete one of the alternate shading models
- [x] Special `vary` curves
- [ ] Moving lights with `vary`
- [ ] `light`
- [ ] `set`
- [ ] `saveknobs`
- [ ] `tween`

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] `mesh`
- [ ] Texture mapping
---
## The Details
- Supersampling has been implemented at 16 samples per pixel.
- I plan to mainly focus on completing the alternate shading model first. Likely Gouraud or Phong interpolation, though I might try raytracing if I have time.
- All of the other commands will be implemented as described on the assignment page, mostly as a convenience for generating animation.
- After that will come the mesh obj parsing, if I have time.
- If I have time I will look to texture mapping onto my triangles.
